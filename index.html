Emma once made a speech  questioning gender-based assumptions at age eight when she was called "bossy" (a trait she has attributed to her being a "perfectionist") whilst boys were not, and at 14 when she was "sexualised by certain elements of the media".Watson's speech also called feminism "the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities" and declared that the perception of "man-hating" is something that "has to stop".Watson later said she received threats within 12 hours of making the speech, which left her "raging.... If they were trying to put me off of doing this work, it did the opposite".
